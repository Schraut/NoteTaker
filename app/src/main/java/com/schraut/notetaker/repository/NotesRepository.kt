package com.schraut.notetaker.repository

// A repository acts as an intermediary layer between the UI (like your
// ViewModel) and data sources (such as local databases or remote APIs), providing a single,
// centralized point for data management. It abstracts away the complexity of fetching, storing,
// and updating data, offering a clean API to the rest of the application. This separation of
// concerns makes the codebase more organized, scalable, and easier to test and maintain, as the UI
// components don't need to know the specifics of how data is sourced or structured
